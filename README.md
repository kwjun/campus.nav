# Campus Navigator

This is the group proejct

Updating this so that we can create a schema of whom is doing what:

So far I have added a few view controllers, but no meat to them. I am gonna put all our names here and we can add what we have done / are going to do.

I am creating a template, and if you have an idea of what you want to add to the project as your part, then just email me / us and we can figure it out.

So far Peter has used PLists for favourites (or so far they are just classrooms), but I think we should use a database to hold a list of "all' the classrooms (though I htink we will just have like 10 hardcoded in, as I'm and I assume you guys aren't going to go around getting classroom locations, lol).

Possibly another database, with a way to add events that are around campus (just for some more stuff to do).
